## Comoving distance

The (line-of-sight) comoving distance _D_<sub>c</sub> is the distance between two nearby points that move strictly along the Hubble flow.
As a result, it is constant in time.
The comoving distance is the fundamental distance measure in cosmology, as all others are derived from it.

The comoving distance can be calculated from the dimensionless Hubble parameter _E_ via
