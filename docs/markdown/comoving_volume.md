## Comoving volume

The comoving volume _V_<sub>C</sub> is the volume measure in which the density of particles (e.g. galaxies) moving along the Hubble flow is constant with respect to the redshift.
The exact form of the comoving volume depends on the geometry; integrated over the whole sky up to redshift _z_, it has the following forms:
