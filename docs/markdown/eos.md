## Equation of state parameters

The Friedmann equations can only be solved once an equation of state has been imposed.
The equation of state relates the energy density and pressure of a given component of the total mass density of the Universe.

In order to model the accelerated expansion of the Universe it is convenient to allow the equation of state parameter _w_ to evolve over the course of the Universe's expansion history.
A convenient parametrisation in terms of two new parameters _w_₀ and _w_ₐ is
