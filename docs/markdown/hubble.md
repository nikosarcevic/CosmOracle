## Hubble constant H₀

The Hubble parameter _H_ quantifies the relative expansion of space throughout the expansion history of the Universe.
The Hubble constant _H_₀ parametrises the value of _H_ in the current epoch.

The Hubble parameter is computed from the scale factor _a_ and its time derivative via the relation
