# CosmΩracle

Hello and welcome to CosmΩracle!

CosmΩracle is an app that calculates distances in cosmology. 
If you wish to compute the values of cosmologically relevant distances — choose the _Cosmological distances_ option in the sidebar, fill the values of cosmological parameters and press enter. 
Note that the default cosmology is already set.

CosmΩracle can also plot those distances as a function of redshift. 
In case you want to plot it yourself — you can easily download the data in a .txt format.
