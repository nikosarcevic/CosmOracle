## Lookback time

The lookback time _t_<sub>L</sub> to an object is the time difference between the moment in which a photon is emitted by this object and the moment in which that photon is observed.

If the object of interest is located at redshift _z_ the lookback time can be computed in terms of the function _E(z)_ defined above via the relation
