## Luminosity distance

The luminosity distance _D_<sub>L</sub> is defined as the distance an object of bolometric luminosity _L_ is measured to have a bolometric flux _S_, _i.e._ at which _L_=4π_D_<sub>L</sub>²_S_.

It is related to the angular diameter distance (and hence the transverse comoving distance) via the relation
