## Redshift z

The cosmological scale factor _a_ quantifies the expansion of space, where it is conventional to take the present value of the scale factor to be equal to 1.
The redshift _z_ is the increase in wavelength of electromagnetic radiation as a result of the increase in the cosmological scale factor. 
It can be computed in terms of the scale factor via the relation
