## Transverse comoving distance

The distance between two comoving objects in the sky, at equal redshift by separated by an angle _δθ_, is _D_<sub>M</sub>_δθ_.
The quantity _D_<sub>M</sub> is the transverse comoving distance.

It turns out that the transverse comoving distance can be expressed in terms of the comoving distance _D_<sub>C</sub>.
Its explicit form depends on the spatial geometry of the Universe, which is indicated in the different cases below:
